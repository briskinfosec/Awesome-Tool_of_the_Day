WFuzz
============
Wfuzz is a command line tool written in python. It is used to discover common vulnerabilities in web applications through the method of fuzzing. Fuzzing is the concept of trying many known vulnerable inputs with a web application to determine if any of the inputs compromise the web application. It is a great tool to be able to quickly check common vulnerabilities against an application. It is also valuable for testing previously reported vulnerabilities to ensure that regressions donâ€™t occur in an application.
